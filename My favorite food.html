    <h1>My favorite food is Nahari</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>This is a paragraph on how to make Nahari.Meat: 1 kg beef or mutton shank (with bones for richness).
    Aromatics: 1 large onion (thinly sliced), 2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste.
    Thickener: ¼ cup whole wheat flour (atta) mixed into a smooth slurry with 1 cup water.
    Fats: ½ cup oil or ghee.
    Nihari Masala: A mix of fennel, dry ginger (sonth), long pepper (pipli), black cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg.
    Garnish: Ginger juliennes, fresh coriander, green chillies, and lemon wedges.
    Cooking Instructions
    Brown the Meat: Heat oil/ghee in a heavy-bottomed pot. Sauté sliced onions until golden brown. Add the meat and
    ginger-garlic paste, searing until the meat changes colour.
    Spice Infusion: Add the Nihari masala, red chilli powder, turmeric, and salt. Stir for 1–2 minutes to release the
    aromas.
    Slow Simmer: Pour in 6–8 cups of water. Bring to a boil, then cover and simmer on very low heat. Cook beef for 4–6 hours
    or mutton for 1.5–2 hours until the meat is "fall-apart" tender.
    Extract Oil (Optional): Before thickening, you may skim off the top layer of red oil (tarri) and set it aside to pour
    back over the dish before serving.
    Thicken: Gradually pour the wheat flour slurry into the pot while stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Simmer for
    another 15–30 minutes until the gravy reaches a smooth, thick consistency.
    Final Touch: Return the reserved oil to the pot. Serve hot with naan or sheermal, topped with fresh garnishes.
