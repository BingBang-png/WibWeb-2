    <h1> My favorite cartoon is Phineas and Ferb<h1>
        <p> This is pargraph about my favorite cartoon Phineas and Ferb is a critically acclaimed American animated musical-comedy series created by Dan Povenmire and Jeff
        "Swampy" Marsh for Disney. Running from 2007 to 2015, with a revival premiering in 2025, the show centers on
        stepbrothers Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher during their 104-day summer vacation, where they strive to make every day
        exciting by constructing, inventing, and embarking on grand, often physically impossible projects. Their older sister,
        Candace, makes it her mission to "bust" them by exposing their creations to their mother, though she fails every time.
        Concurrently, their pet platypus, Perry, leads a secret double life as "Agent P," battling the comically inept evil
        scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, whose own schemes almost always end up destroying the boys' projects just before they
        can be discovered. Known for its witty, formulaic humor, catchy original songs in nearly every episode, and broad appeal
        to children and adults, Phineas and Ferb has become one of Disney's most successful franchises.(I don't watch cartoons any more)</p>
